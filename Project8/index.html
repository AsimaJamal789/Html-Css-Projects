        <h3>An Introduction to JavaScript</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            Let’s see what’s so special about JavaScript, what we can achieve
            with it, and what other technologies play well with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The syntax of JavaScript does not suit everyone’s needs. Different
            people want different features. That’s to be expected, because
            projects and requirements are different for everyone. So, recently a
            plethora of new languages appeared, which are transpiled (converted)
            to JavaScript before they run in the browser. Modern tools make the
            transpilation very fast and transparent, actually allowing
            developers to code in another language and auto-converting it “under
            the hood”.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name:
              “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was
              decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of
              Java would help.
            </li>
            <li>
              But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language
              with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no
              relation to Java at all.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section id="h1">
        <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
        <article>
          <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.</p>
          <p>
            The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be
            written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page
            loads.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need
            special preparation or compilation to run.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language
            called Java.
          </p>

          <code
            >// Basic Javascript Function to display the name in alert is given
            function myFunction(name) { alert("your name is " +name) }
            myFunction("areej");
          </code>
          select the given code copy and run in your browser to see the output.

        <h3>What can in-browser JavaScript do?</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not
            provide low-level access to memory or the CPU, because it was
            initially created for browsers which do not require it.Remember the
            data on the client-side (“local storage”).
          </p>
          JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s
          running in. For instance, Node.js supports functions that allow
          JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests,
          etc.
          <p>
            In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage
            manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.
          </p>
          For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify
              styles.
            </li>
            <li>
              React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key
              presses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and
              upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).
            </li>
            <li>
              Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section id="h3">
        <h3>What CAN’T in-browser JavaScript do?</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            JavaScript’s abilities in the browser are limited to protect the
            user’s safety. The aim is to prevent an evil webpage from accessing
            private information or harming the user’s data.
          </p>
          Examples of such restrictions include:

          <ul>
            <li>
              JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on the
              hard disk, copy them or execute programs. It has no direct access
              to OS functions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Different tabs/windows generally do not know about each other.
              Sometimes they do, for example when one window uses JavaScript to
              open the other one. But even in this case, JavaScript from one
              page may not access the other page if they come from different
              sites (from a different domain, protocol or port).
            </li>
            <li>
              JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server where
              the current page came from. But its ability to receive data from
              other sites/domains is crippled. Though possible, it requires
              explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers) from the remote
              side. Once again, that’s a safety limitation.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section id="h4">
        <h3>What makes JavaScript unique?</h3>
        <article>
          <p>There are at least three great things about JavaScript:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Full integration with HTML/CSS.</li>
            <li>Full integration with HTML/CSS.</li>
            <li>Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three
            things. <p>That’s what makes JavaScript unique. That’s why it’s the
            most widespread tool for creating browser interfaces.</p> That said,
            JavaScript can be used to create servers, mobile applications, etc.
          </p>

        <h3>Languages “over” JavaScript</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            The syntax of JavaScript does not suit everyone’s needs. Different people want different features.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s to be expected, because projects and requirements are different for everyone.
          </p>
Modern tools make the transpilation very fast and transparent, actually allowing developers to code in another language and auto-converting it “under the hood”.
          <ul>
            <li>
            CoffeeScript is “syntactic sugar” for JavaScript. It introduces shorter syntax, allowing us to write clearer and more precise code. Usually, Ruby devs like it.
            </li>
            <li>
             Flow also adds data typing, but in a different way. Developed by Facebook.

        <article>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only language, but it is now used in many other environments as well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Today, JavaScript has a unique position as the most widely-adopted browser language, fully integrated with HTML/CSS.
            </li>
            <li>There are many languages that get “transpiled” to JavaScript and provide certain features. It is recommended to take a look at them, at least briefly, after mastering JavaScript.</li>
